# Cursor Project Rules

This directory contains project-specific rules and guidelines for Cursor AI to follow when working with this codebase.

## Structure

- `rules/pmg-project.md` - Main project rules covering code style, conventions, and best practices

## Usage

Cursor will automatically read these rules and apply them when:
- Generating code
- Providing suggestions
- Answering questions about the codebase
- Making recommendations

## Migration

These rules were migrated from the old `.cursorrules` file to the new `.cursor/rules` structure for better organization and maintainability.

## Updating Rules

To modify project rules:
1. Edit the appropriate `.md` file in the `rules/` directory
2. Rules are automatically applied by Cursor
3. No restart required

      things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation,
      in the right use of ordinary means, attain thereunto.[2] And therefore it is
      the duty of everyone to give all diligence to make his calling and election
      sure;[3] that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy
      Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in
      the duties of obedience,[4] the proper fruits of this assurance: so far is it
      from inclining men to looseness.[5]'

      shall oppose any lawful power, or the lawful exercise of it, whether it be civil
      or ecclesiastical, resist the ordinance of God.[1] And for their publishing
      of such opinions, or maintaining of such practices, as are contrary to the light
      of nature, or to the known principles of Christianity, whether concerning faith,
      worship, or conversation; or to the power of godliness; or such erroneous opinions

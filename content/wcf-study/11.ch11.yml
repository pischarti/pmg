    - 4.So how do those effectually called and justified meet God's righteous standard?
    - 5.Is God just? Are we just? Why is that a problem?
    - 6.Luther declared in the sixteenth century that the doctrine of justification by faith alone is the article upon which the church stands or falls. Calvin used a different metaphor; he  said it is the hinge upon which everything turns. So why do you think so few people get exercised about the doctrine of justification today?

    - 1.To be justified, what does a person need to add to faith?
    - 2.If justification is by faith alone, what did the writers of the WCF mean when they said, that faith is "ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love"?
    - 3.What do you think the authors of the WCF meant by referring to faith as an "instrument"?

    - 5.Is our faith a meritorious work? What does this section say it is?
    - 6.The Reformers had a saying, "Justification is by faith alone, but not by a faith that is alone." What did they mean?
    - 7.Does Paul in Romans Chapter 3 contradict James in James Chapter 2? Explain your answer.
    - 8.Saving faith, according to the Reformers, has three essential elements, without which there is no salvation. They are notitia, assensus, and fiducia (content, assent, and trust). Explain what the Reformers meant in your own words.

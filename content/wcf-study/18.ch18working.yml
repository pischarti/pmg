  - Content: 'Although hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themselves
      with false hopes and carnal presumptions of being in the favour of God and estate
      of salvation, which hope of theirs shall perish: yet such as truly believe in
      the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good conscience
      before him, may in this life be certainly assured that they are in a state of
      grace, and may rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, which hope shall never
      make them ashamed.'
    ContentWithProofs: Although hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive
      themselves with false hopes and carnal presumptions of being in the favour of
      God and estate of salvation,[1] which hope of theirs shall perish:[2] yet such
      as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to
      walk in all good conscience before him, may in this life be certainly assured
      that they are in a state of grace,[3] and may rejoice in the hope of the glory
      of God, which hope shall never make them ashamed.[4]

  - Content: 'This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion, grounded
      upon a fallible hope; but an infallible assurance of faith, founded upon the
      divine truth of the promises of salvation, the inward evidence of those graces
      unto which these promises are made, the testimony of the Spirit of adoption
      witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God: which Spirit is
      the earnest of our inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption.'

  - Content: 'This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of faith,
      but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties
      before he be partaker of it: yet, being enabled by the Spirit to know the things
      which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation,
      in the right use of ordinary means, attain thereunto. And therefore it is the
      duty of everyone to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure;
      that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in
      love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties
      of obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance: so far is it from inclining
      men to looseness.'

  - Content: 'True believers may have the assurance of their salvation divers ways
      shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as, by negligence in preserving of it;
      by falling into some special sin, which woundeth the conscience, and grieveth
      the Spirit; by some sudden or vehement temptation; by God''s withdrawing the
      light of his countenance, and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness
      and to have no light: yet are they never utterly destitute of that seed of God,
      and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart
      and conscience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance
      may in due time be revived, and by the which, in the meantime, they are supported
      from utter despair.'

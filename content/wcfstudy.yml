  Title: Westminster Confession Study Guide
  Version: 1.0
  Year: '2024'
Data:
- Chapter: 'Introduction'  
  Sections:
  - Content: What do Americans believe about God, salvation, ethics, and the Bible?
      Ligonier Ministries and LifeWay Research partnered to find out. Every two
      years, they take the theological temperature of the United States to help Christians
      better understand today's culture and to equip the church with better insights
      for discipleship.
    Section: '1'
  - Content: The trend shown by these studies is depressing. Our culture is increasingly ignorant
      of fundamental Biblical truth. This will come as no surprise to any follower of
      Christ, especially those who are from the Reformed tradition.
    Section: '2'
  - Content: Why is this so? Many reasons could be given, including the the secular indoctrination
      of the government school system, the "paganization" of the media (both
      entertainment and news), and the fact that our lives are increasingly dominated
      by the political process as the primary means of cultural improvement.
    Section: '3'
  - Content: I suspect the deeper cause can be found in the Ligonier survey itself. Those studies
      show that the decline in Biblical understanding in the broader culture is mirrored
      by the decline in those calling themselves "Evangelicals." Even within
      Reformed circles, understanding of the Biblical narrative appears weaker as time
      passes. 
    Secton: '4'
  - Content: So which is the cart and which is the horse? Is the culture leading the church
      into apostasy, or is the church failing in its mission to lead the culture into
      truth? 
    Section: '5'
  - Content: I believe it is the latter. We are called to be a blessing to the nations, making
      disciples by teaching them all that Christ commanded (Mt 28:18-20). But how can
      we do that when we ourselves don't bathe ourselves in the deep truths of
      God's Word? If we fail in that fundamental calling we will too often simply
      offer the world its own bromides sprinkled with some Gospel pleasantries.
    Section: '6'
  - Content: I have written this study guide to help the student of the Westminster Confession
      of Faith (WCF) to maintain their focus while wading through its many chapters
      and sections. The study guide's method is to ask questions to assist the
      student in answering three basic questions
      - 1.What are the Westminster divines saying?
      - 2.What does this mean in its biblical and historic context? 
      - 3.How do I apply these truths in my life and more broadly, how should the church
        apply them to its ministry?
    Section: '7'
  - Content: I would encourage the user of this guide to read each chapter section of the WCF
      and its "proof texts" multiple times, striving to answer these three
      questions for yourself before completing the study guide questions.
    Section: '8'

      your study.
